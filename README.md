```
A and B select their own private number,
A and B select two public numbers; one is modulo, the other is radix.
A and B build their own public-private number (PPN),
PPN=radix^private number mod modulo
A and B mingle the other party's PPN with private number,
(a^b)^c=(a^c)^b=a^(bc)
A and B both get the shared key.
